					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main goal of this lab was to teach us how to organize and structure our local files on our computers in order to ensure that all of our code works correctly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a little bit of difficulty getting the screenshots to appear on my site, but after some trial and error, I was able to both link the images correctly from the Lab 3 img folder, as well as size them correctly. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results of my lab produced this page that you are currently looking at! </p>
