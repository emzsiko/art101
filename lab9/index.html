			<div id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab is to practice creating buttons to modify elements on a page utilizing jQuery.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a little bit of trouble initially getting the buttons to work, but eventually, we were able to figure out that it was because we forgot to put the "#" in front of "button-challenge" when we were creating the click listener.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You can see our live webpage with our results here! Try clicking the buttons!</p>
