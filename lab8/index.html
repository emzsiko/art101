					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab is to practice using anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We encounted no major problems with this lab, however, we kept getting an error within the console saying that the array we created had already been declared. After some troubleshooting, we realized that it was because we had linked to our js file twice, and we were able to solve it.</p>
