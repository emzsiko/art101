			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to get practice thinking using pseudocoding, serving as an intermediary step before just jumping straight into coding directly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While we didn't run into any problems completing the tasks of the lab, the biggest problem we had was finding the time to complete everything. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab shows how the idea and way of thinking of coding can be applied to many other tasks within our lives, as we can see with the first task of the lab. It's interesting to think about how learning to code can give us other skills beyond just the act of coding itself, and it's something that we can apply to our other interests. </p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
					<h2>Task 1:</h2>
					<p>
						Brushing your teeth:<br>
						1. Grab toothbrush and toothpaste<br>
						2. Wet bristles of toothbrush<br>
						3. Squeeze small drop of toothpaste onto the bristles<br>
						4. Wet the toothpaste<br>
						5. Open mouth<br>
						6. Place toothpaste onto teeth<br>
						7. Move the toothbrush in small circular motions<br>
							a. Continue for 2 minutes<br>
						8. Spit out toothpaste into the sink<br>
						9. inse toothbrush<br>
						10. Add water into your mouth and swish<br>
						11. Spit out the water<br>
					</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Task 2:</h2>
					<pre><code>
						// Creating a rock-paper-scissors game:
						// Prepare the three options (rock, paper, or scissors)
						// Determine which options beat each other, and which ones lose to each other
							// Rock beats scissors
							// Paper beats rock
							// Scissors beats paper
						// Accept user input
							// Set up variable userInput
							// Assign user input to variable
						// Randomly select one option for the computer
							// Set up variable cpuInput
							// Assign computer choice to variable
						// Calculate the winner
							// Loop through possible outcomes based on userInput
							// Print correct results
					</pre></code>
